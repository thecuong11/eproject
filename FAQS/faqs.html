          <p>
            <strong>How can I cancel an order that I’ve placed?</strong><br>
            If you’d like to cancel an order within 24 hours of placing it, please email us at teamworktttc@gmail.com with your order number and we’ll do what we can to help. If your order contains monogramming, you may not be able to cancel as the monogramming process is initiated immediately. Please contact teamworktttc@gmail.com to check the status of your order.
          </p>  
          <p>
            <strong>How can I add an item to my order?</strong><br>
            We understand that sometimes you may want to add more RYANA CALENDARS goodies to your order, however once an order is submitted, we’re unable to change it – even if it’s still processing. If you’d like to purchase more items, we recommend placing a separate order.
          </p>  
          <p>
            <strong>Can I make any changes to my order?</strong><br>
            We aim to process and pack your order as fast as possible which means we're unable to make any changes once you've placed an order.<br>
            However, you may be able to cancel your order and place a new one instead (excluding monogrammed products). Please contact teamworktttc@gmail.com and we'd love to see how we can help.
          </p>  
          <p>
            <strong>What does Processing/Completed mean on my online order?</strong><br>
            Once you have submitted your RYANA CALENDARS order, it will display as ‘Processing’ in your account as our Online team work to prepare your order for delivery. When your order is ‘Completed’, your order has left our facility for delivery and is now on its way to you!
          </p>  
          <p>
            <strong>What do I do if I want a refund or exchange on a RYANA CALENDARS product?</strong><br>
            You’re welcome to take the items into any of our retail stores, where our team members will be able to help you with an exchange, credit note or refund. Alternatively, you can post the items directly to our Head Office with a completed Return Form and we will contact you as soon as it arrives.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What do I do if I have received a faulty product?</strong><br>
            Please bring your product into your local RYANA CALENDARS store or contact us at teamworktttc@gmail.com providing photos and proof of purchase, and our team would love to assist further.

            <strong>I’m having troubles placing an order online, can you help?</strong><br>
            From time to time, you may experience difficulties out of our control, and we understand this can be a little frustrating when you’re eager for some RYANA CALENDARS love! We recommend the following tips:
          </p>
          <p>
            • Clear your cache and any cookies from your browser.<br>
            • Try a different web browser - using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are the easiest to browse and shop on most websites, including ours.<br>
            • Log in/log out of your account again.<br>
            • Change world store views (i.e., if you are on AU, switch to NZ, then switch back to AU to reset things).<br>
            • Try using a different device (sometimes using a desktop may help).<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you continue to experience any issues, please don’t hesitate to contact us at teamworktttc@gmail.com and we will find an alternative solution to help you place your order online.

          <h3><br>
          <span>SHIPPING AND DELIVERY</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong><br>
            Yes, we ship worldwide. Please make sure you select your region (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, USA, UK, or Worldwide stores for all other regions) in the top right hand corner of the page to shop internationally.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Can I enter my address in a language other than English?</strong><br>
            We encourage you to enter your shipping address in English. This can avoid delays with your order, and ensures that your order is delivered correctly. If it is necessary to enter your address in your localized language, for example in Cyrillic or Pinyin, please ensure that both are entered in the shipping address field.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How long does it take to process an order?</strong><br>
            If you place an order on a weekend, your order should be processed the following business day. Please note this can take longer during sale or busy periods. We recommend allowing 1-2 business days from placing your order for your items to be dispatched.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How can I track my order?</strong><br>
            When your order is dispatched, we’ll send you an email to let you know. You’ll receive another email shortly after with your tracking information which you can use to follow your parcel’s journey. If your delivery address is outside of the UK, you can track your parcel on the Australia Post website here. For orders shipping to the UK, you can track your parcel on the Royal Mail website here. Please allow up to 24 hours from receiving the dispatch email for your tracking information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I haven’t received my order, what do I do?</strong><br>
            You will receive a tracking number one your order is dispatched, and you can use this to track the location of your order. If there seems to be a delay or no updates, you can contact the postal service that is handling your order and quote your tracking number to investigate it further. Alternatively, you can also contact us at teamworktttc@gmail.com with your order number and tracking number.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why have I only received part of my order?</strong><br>
            Occasionally, we run out of stock of some items. If you have ordered an item that is out of stock, we will ship the rest of your order and be in contact about the missing item(s). This allows you to receive your order promptly without delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How much will I be charged for customs tax?</strong><br>
            Depending on the destination country, you may need to pay overseas customs duties, foreign taxes or other fees that may be imposed. Unless otherwise stated, it is the customer’s responsibility to pay any overseas customs duties, foreign taxes or other fees that may be imposed. For more information on taxes, duties and customs regulations please contact your local customs office directly. Orders returned to our warehouse due to unpaid customs duties/foreign taxes will be cancelled and refunded.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you decide not to pay for the customs fee, the parcel will eventually be returned to our Head Office, where we will then be able to refund you for your order.
          </p>
          <p>
