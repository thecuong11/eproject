        <p>From time to time, you may experience difficulties out of our control, and we understand this can be a little frustrating when you’re eager for some RYANA CALENDARS love! We recommend the following tips:<br>
              • Clear your cache and any cookies from your browser.<br>
              • Try a different web browser - using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are the easiest to browse and shop on most websites, including ours.<br>
              • Log in/log out of your account again.<br>
              • Change world store views (i.e., if you are on AU, switch to NZ, then switch back to AU to reset things).<br>
              • Try using a different device (sometimes using a desktop may help).<br>
               If you continue to experience any issues, please don’t hesitate to contact us at teamworktttc@gmail.com and we will find an alternative solution to help you place your order online.</p>
